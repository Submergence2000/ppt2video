# ppt2video - Enhance Your Study Efficiency with High-Speed Revision

Now you can convert your PowerPoint presentations into videos, allowing you to review the content at twice the speed for maximum productivity.

## Requirements:

- PPT files must be in the pptx format and have unencrypted narration.
- Compatible with Windows 10 and Office versions higher than 2010.

## How to Use:

1. Organize all the PPT files you wish to convert into the designated "ppt" folder.
2. Launch the "main.exe" program and follow the instructions to specify the desired resolution.
3. The resulting videos will be automatically saved in the convenient "video" folder.

## Future Possibilities:

1. Introduce multi-threading capabilities to accelerate further the conversion process (currently, even the powerful 8550u integrated graphics and CPU are not fully utilized).
2. Explore alternative methods for audio extraction from PPT files, enabling direct integration with video, and eliminating the need for PowerPoint backend calls.
3. Develop a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) to enhance the overall experience (please note that GUI development is not currently supported).
